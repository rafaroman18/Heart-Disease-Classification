# Heart Disease Classification
**Machine Learning** project created to predict **Heart Disease** on patients thanks to the **dataset** provided by **UCI Machine Learning Repository**: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease

To do this we will be using these technologies:
* **Pandas**
* **NumPy**
* **SciKit-Learn**
* **Matplotlib**
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **Python**

Also, this is a problem of **classification** since each patient will be tagged as "1" (heart disease) or "0" (no heart disease).

We will be doing building our model through a Jupyter Notebook contained in the `Classification` folder so we can test at the moment every manipulation or visualization of the data.

The main goal of this project is to **accomplish a 95% of accuracy** so we can say that we have a very robust model. To make this we will be doing some processes like **evaluating** the model, **improving** it and **testing** it in different scenarios.
